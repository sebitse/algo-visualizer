# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a C++ program that visualizes various sorting algorithms using the SDL2 graphics library. 
It provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms to aid in understanding their operations and performance.

## Features

- Visualize the following sorting algorithms:
-- Insertion Sort
-- Bubble Sort
-- Quick Sort
-- Selection Sort
-- Heap Sort (under development)
- Customize visualization parameters such as window size, delay between frames, and color scheme.

## Dependencies

- Ensure SDL2 is installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager or download it from the SDL website.
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git```

- Navigate to the project directory:
```cd algorithm-visualizer```

- Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as g++:
```make all```


## Usage

```./program```
